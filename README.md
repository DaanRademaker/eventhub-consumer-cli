# Contributing
Feel free in any way to contribute and improve the code. When developping I suggest running the cli tool in editable mode. This means that you do not have to keep reinstalling the package but changes saved to consumer.py will be automatically reflected in the cli command. To install the package in editable mode run the following:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
